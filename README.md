# Search Br :mag_right:

- The same project with REACT one[React Project](https://github.com/Ned-Magician/SearchBar-REACT) but Using Javascript and different system to requests(axios VS fetch).
- This search bar has created with Javascript by sending a fetch request to Unsplash.
- This landing page uses `HTML, CSS, JavaScript.`

- This is a professional code design.
- It's beautiful in terms of UX and makes the code compile easily.
